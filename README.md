<h3>What actually is a KML file?</h3>
<a href="https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kml_tut">KML<a/> is a file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser such as Google Earth. KML uses a tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes and is based on the XML standard.
